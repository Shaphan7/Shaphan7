👋 Hi, I'm Shaphan!

👀 I'm passionate about coding, and I'm currently focusing on Python.

🌱 I'm in the process of learning Python and exploring its various applications.

💞️ I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on Python projects to make them the best they can be. If you have any project ideas or need a hand with coding, feel free to reach out!
